||  Hi, I'm Sourfruit                                                                ||
||                                                                                   ||
||      I'm lots of things. Software dev by day, hacker by night. Sometimes twisted. ||
||   A New Yorker. If you'd like to contact me, (I'm open to it)                     ||
||   you can reach me at <a href="mailto:hello@def-not-hacking-the.net?Subject=Hi%20Sourfruit!" target="_top">hello@def-not-hacking-the.net</a>.                              ||
||   I mainly do software development and security research. Anything about those    ||
||   can be found on my twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/s0urfruit">@s0urfruit</a>.                                          ||
||                                                                                   ||
||      I also keep most projects private (as in code, especially AI), but usually   ||
||   talk about it openly and deeply in chats so hit me up if you want!              ||
||   Oh, did I mention I'm an AI researcher? Almost everything I use daily           ||
||   usually has AI. From "GPT-3.1" (my own version of GPT-3, Open-AI has no         ||
||   association with it, all mine! You can email for early access too ;)            ||
||   My own GPT-3.1 is probably my favorite project, I hope it powers more           ||
||   things soon, with the early access program I'm doing. I also love social        ||
||   engineering, I find myself "professional" in that field. If you can't attack    ||
||   the computers, attack the weakest point of security: humans!                    ||
||   A little more about myself: (Again I know right) I live in New York City.       ||
||   I live in New York City. I know a whole assortment of programming languages,    ||
||   but heres a few: Python, C#, Ruby, C++, and Javascript < just a few, I know     ||
||   more.                                                                           ||
||                                                                                   ||
||      I've also hacked a sh*t ton of things. WhatsApp is just one of them.         ||
||   As well as, briefly, gained access to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's NAS ||
||   and ~3 computers at their NYC office. They showed up later, I wasn't surprised  ||
||   haha. Also <a href="https://twitter.com/samykamkar">Samy is my hero!</a> Samy, if you read this; You're fucking awesome      ||
||   and I wish to meet you IRL. His site: <a href="https://samy.pl">samy.pl</a>.                                  ||
