||  Hi, I'm Sourfruit                                                               ||
||                                                                                  ||
||     I'm lots of things. Software dev by day, hacker by night. Sometimes twisted. ||
||  A New Yorker. If you'd like to contact me, (I'm open to it)                     ||
||  you can reach me at <a href="mailto:hello@def-not-hacking-the.net?Subject=Hi%20Sourfruit!" target="_top">hello@def-not-hacking-the.net</a>.                              ||
||  I mainly do software development and security research. Anything about those    ||
||  can be found on my twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/s0urfruit">@s0urfruit</a>.                                          ||
||                                                                                  ||
||     I also keep most projects private (as in code, especially AI), but usually   ||
||  talk about it openly and deeply in chats so hit me up if you want!              ||
||  Oh, did I mention I'm an AI researcher? Almost everything I use daily           ||
||  usually has AI. From "GPT-3.1" (my own version of GPT-3, Open-AI has no         ||
||  association with it, all mine! You can email for early access too ;)            ||
||                                                                                  ||
||  I also love social engineering (SE). It's an awesome skill to have in my        ||
||  opinion. I find myself "professional" in that field. If you can't attack        ||
||  the computers, attack the weakest point of security: humans!                    ||
||                                                                                  ||
||  A little more about myself: (Again I know right) I live in New York City.       ||
||  I know a whole assortment of programming languages,                             ||
||  but heres a few: Python, C#, Ruby, C++, and Javascript < just a few, I know     ||
||  more.                                                                           ||
||                                                                                  ||
||     I've also hacked a sh*t ton of things, software, and getting into hardware   ||
||  As well as, briefly, gained access to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's NAS ||
||  and ~3 computers at their NYC office. They showed up later, I wasn't surprised  ||
||  haha. Also <a href="https://twitter.com/samykamkar">Samy is my hero!</a> Samy, if you read this; You're fucking awesome      ||
||  and I wish to meet you IRL. His site: <a href="https://samy.pl">samy.pl</a>.                                  ||

||                                                                                  ||
||                                                                                  ||
