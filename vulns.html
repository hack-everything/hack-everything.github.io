||                                                                                   ||
||  Vulnerabilities or vulns for short. Companies hate them, hackers love them.      ||
||                                                                                   ||
||      This will be a page dedicated to all of the vulnerabilities that I'm         ||
||   "allowed" to talk about. It's quite a fine line, but maybe some older stuff    ||
||   I can talk about. Also '@LG' y'all ever going to push an update to your        ||
||   smart-fridges? Its not sad, but disappointing when companies don't reply to    ||
||   your emails talking about (at times) critical vulnerabilities. And the "news"  ||
||   is: quite a few don't. AND sometimes you have a conversation like this:        ||
||                                                                                   ||
||    Company: "Are you saying we have a security issue in our software?"            ||
||    Me: "Yes"                                                                      ||
||    Company: "Impossible, we secured this, it is unhackable"                       ||
||    Me: "I just found a vulnerability"                                             ||
||    Company: "Well, we haven't, so it is fine"                                     ||
||                                                                                   ||
||      And its crap like that, that just makes you want to use HackerOne for        ||
||   example since companies are bit more forced to reply/investigate. But, I        ||
||   prefer talking to companies directly, and not through eg. HackerOne.            ||
||   I'll be building a "blog" on here soon, so please, just wait for some possible  ||
||   awesome content.                                                                ||
||                                                                                   ||
||   This site will continue to be updated.                                          ||
||                                                                                   ||
||     - SOURFRUIT                                                                   ||
||                                                                                   ||
