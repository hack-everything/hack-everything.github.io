||  Welcome to the page of my own GPT-3, named GPT-3.1                               ||
||                                                                                   ||
||      I created my own GPT-3, since Open-AI refused to give me access to the beta. ||
||    So, in my fashion, if you can't get it, make it. I set off on journey to       ||
||    "re-create" GPT-3. I got 2.9TiBs of data, and after a lot of training,         ||
||    1.6TiBs of which have been put into GPT-3.1. I've been using it for a while,   ||
||    in various projects. One of which is a 'code writer' that writes code for you, ||
||    just give it some instructions like  [ purple button with the text "test" and  ||
||    a header with the text "Button Test" ], and it'd make it. (Images coming soon) ||
||                                                                                   ||
||      I'm also starting a beta! Please email <a href="mailto:hello@def-not-hacking-the.net?Subject=GPT-3.1%20Beta" target="_top">hello@def-not-hacking-the.net</a> to      ||
||   sign-up for the beta of GPT-3.1. I'm planning on training on the last 1.2TiBs   ||
||   starting next month, and that will take a while with an eGPU. (1.6TiBs before   ||
||   was trained on a awesome server, that I unfortunately "lost". RIP server        ||
||                                                                                   ||
||      Just a mini-"disclaimer" Open-AI has no association with this, and I doubt   ||
||   they know I, or my GPT-3.1 exists.                                              ||
||                                                                                   ||
||      Honorable mention: <a href="https://eleuther.ai">EleutherAI</a>. They're doing cool stuff!                     ||
||   They're a grassroots AI research group aimed at democratizing and open sourcing ||
||   AI research, and their current primary project is an open source                ||
||   reimplementation of GPT-3. You can contact them on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/e6QcvqQ">Discord</a>                      ||
